The assigning player chooses which ability or effect applies, and\nthen resolves the assignment. If this creates a situation where now more than one\nunit must be assigned with the same priority, those units may be assigned damage\nin any order as normal within that priority.\nExample: Two copies of Caitlyn, Patrolling (\"I must be assigned combat\ndamage last.\") have been given the Tank ability (\"I must be assigned\ncombat damage first.\"). A player assigning damage to these two Caitlyns\nand one unit with no abilities could choose to fulfill both Caitlyns’ Tank\nrequirements by assigning them both damage before the other unit."
